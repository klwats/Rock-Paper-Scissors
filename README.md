# Rock-Paper-Scissors

### Abstract
This game allows a user to play Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer. It offers 2 different versions of the game, classic and difficult. The difficult version adds two additional options to the mix (iguana and alien). They can keep track of their wins and go between versions as they please.

### Context
I am currently in week 6 of the Mod1 Front End Engineering Program.
This project took me about 30 hours to complete.

### Learning Goals
Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
DRY JavaScript
Event delegation to handle similar event listeners
Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge

### Wins + Challenges
I am very proud of the fact that I was able to tackle this project with very few instructions provided.
I had a difficult time getting the site to display the correct image associated with each choice (computer and human). I was able to research and utilize two methods that I hadn't used before: cloneNode and appendChild.
